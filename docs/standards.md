## Comments
Each file should have it's own file comment with the authors name and a description of it's usecase
```
/**
* @author _authors_name
* @justification this file does cool stuff
**/
```

Each function should have a propper function comment including the authors name
```
/**
* @author _authors_name
* @param _parameter_name 
* @return _return_value
**/
```

Larger blocks of code should have a descriptive comment outlining what they are for.

## Formating

variable and function names should use "snake case" i.e. 
```
function_name
variable_name
```
indenting should be done by 2 spaces, this can be changed in the editors settings.
